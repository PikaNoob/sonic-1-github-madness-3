Sonic got a tan, grew a tail and gained a serious case of brainrot since his last outting. The rest is history

# Ogorki
Ogorki plans to defame the the white guys candy brand to advertise his pickles

# Anakama
A batch file fetishist Green Hedgehog who just happens to look-alike to our Sonic. Got teleported to the dimension during one of their deviant experiments with batch scripts.

# Limited Sonic (from the rom hack Limited Sonic)
Whilst South Island is restored, Eggman's Limited Curse remains on him, so LimitedSonic now roams the lands trying to find a way to restore himself
and become Unlimited

# Neru
she goofy and maybe even bald

# Gomer Gimpson
Gomer.

# Sailor Mercury
Hearing the allegations of white guy, and seeing Sailor Jupiter manipulated into his side, Sailor Mercury rushes to banish him into the Shadow Realm.
She's also helping to smuggle the Chaos Emgles from Fatman, entirely out of boredom.

# Kiryu
Awoken by the cacophony from Sonics intro cutscene, Kiryu must now fuck shit up in order to go back asleep

# Purple Guy, aka Vincent, The Man Behind The Shots

Now struggling to cum, it's now up to Purple Guy to regain his former glory and win back his lovers affection, by beating up a white guy

# Sans
SANS UNDERTALE?!?!?!!?!??!?!!??!?!?!?!?

# Quagmire
As fortold in the epic tale called "Bee Bush", Glen Quagmire has covered his entire private area in honey, fearfully awaiting the bees.
Quagmire must now return the bees to the hive, lest his std(h) infested sex come to a screeching halt

# Microplastics Reimu
Rightful prisoner of the limited special stage, a storage unit designed for Fatman, Reimu is laced with a special microplastic blend that is contagious, known currently as "cooties" because it only spreads on men, despite being designed to spread onto everything. It is believed that it mutated due to Reimu's residence in the Gensokyo hood.
This allows Reimu to steal the Special Emerals from Fatman, by passing it from Reimu to Sailor Mercury or Neru

# Steve
I am Steve

# Sonic Villains

# Matthew Littlemore, alias. White Guy
White guy is plotting an evil plan to give Free CandyTM to all the land, laced with fetish-obtaining toxic gel that gives you fetishes, or overwrites your pre-existing fetishes with new ones; we're talking about sonic fans.
Many characters fight white guy to end his evil plans, other happen to be on a war path and run into him
Matthew could beat Goku easily let alone any of the others, but chooses to hold back his true power and walk in there shoes, for that is his fetish.
Matthew also turned every hegdehogs face into his own image, which is odd considering his aformentioned fetish

# Teto

# Sailor Jupiter
